## 🌫️ A Quiet Door Opens in Grimshire

There is a certain hush to **Grimshire**—a world where the fog listens, where every footstep is a decision. The *Grimshire Mod Menu* arrives not as thunder, but as a key. A small, precise tool that turns friction into flow, uncertainty into choice.

This README is a lantern-lit walk through the software: what it does, how it breathes with the game, and why so many players choose control without chaos.

## 🧭 Overview: What Is the Grimshire Mod Menu?

The **Grimshire Mod Menu** is a lightweight Windows-based modification tool designed to enhance survival gameplay through configurable systems. It does not rewrite the world—it *reveals its levers*. From resource tuning to combat balance and movement freedom, the menu offers modular control you can toggle at will.

Built for stability and restraint, it prioritizes:

* Selective activation (use only what you need)
* Performance-safe hooks
* Clear, reversible settings

Think of it as a craftsman’s bench rather than a sledgehammer.
